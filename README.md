## Overview of the Project

### The detailed steps of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the NYSERDA-Supported Air Source Heat Pump Projects dataset for 2017-2019. 
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 1. Loading the Data:
- **Objective**: Import the dataset into a data analysis tool (e.g., pandas in Python).
- **Importance**: This step is crucial as it initiates the analysis by providing access to the data.

### 2. Initial Data Inspection:
- **View the first few rows**: Displaying the first few rows helps in understanding the basic structure and contents of the dataset.
- **Check the data types of columns**: Knowing the data types helps in determining the appropriate analysis methods and transformations.
- **Get a summary of the dataset**: Reviewing the number of rows, columns, and any missing values provides a quick overview of the datasetâ€™s completeness and potential issues.

### 3. Data Cleaning:
- Handling missing values.
- Checking for and addressing duplicate rows.
- Converting data types if necessary.

### 4. Descriptive Statistics:
- **Basic statistical measures for numerical columns**:
- **Objective**: Calculate measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range.
- **Importance**: These measures provide insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and overall distribution of numerical data.

### 5. Visualizing Distributions:
- **Histograms for numerical variables**:
- **Objective**: Create visual representations of the distribution of numerical data.
- **Importance**: Histograms reveal the shape, spread, and central tendency of the data, and can highlight skewness or outliers.
- **Bar charts for categorical variables**:
- **Objective**: Visualize the frequency of different categories.
- **Importance**: Bar charts make it easy to compare the sizes of different groups within a categorical variable.

### 6. Exploring Relationships Between Variables:
- **Scatter plots for pairs of numerical variables**:
- **Objective**: Plot numerical variables against each other to identify potential relationships.
- **Importance**: Scatter plots help in visualizing correlations, trends, and potential causal relationships between variables.
- **Heatmap to visualize correlations**:
- **Objective**: Display correlations between numerical variables using color-coded matrices.
- **Importance**: Heatmaps provide a quick and intuitive way to identify strong positive or negative correlations among variables.

### 7. Identifying Outliers:
- **Box plots for numerical variables**:
- **Objective**: Use box plots to identify the spread and detect outliers in numerical data.
- **Importance**: Outliers can significantly affect the results of statistical analyses and visualizations. Identifying and addressing them is crucial for accurate analysis.

### 8. Advanced Visualizations:
- Creating pair plots to explore relationships across multiple variables.
- Using more advanced visualizations if necessary, such as violin plots or swarm plots.
